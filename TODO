- implement a better fire loss
- put some moe thought/effort into parameter bounds to search over
- train sparklin and sparsernet on batch of ~10 fires to at least show that we can overfit the function
- train sparklin and sparsenet on stochastic objective function which randomly picks ~200 / ~10000 per call
- evaluate optimal sparklin and sparsenet on batch of ~10-15 validation fires, using summarize_performance on each ones
